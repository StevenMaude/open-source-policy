# open-source-policy

**NHS Open Source Policy will become officially available in Summer 2022**

open-source-policy.md is the home for all associated policy development, and will be updated frequently in response to subject matter, expert feedback and public comment. It should be treated as a live and living record. Even after policy release, the intention is that this document continues to change to inform future updates.

Contributors should be aware that this document is FOIable, effectively a public archive, and comments should be treated as permanent. Please ensure that you follow the [NHS Values](https://www.hee.nhs.uk/about/our-values/nhs-constitutional-values-hub-0) at all times.

Contributors wishing to comment or suggest changes outside of Github can write to: [andrew.harding@nhsx.nhs.uk](mailto:andrew.harding@nhsx.nhs.uk)

Templates for many of the requirements mentioned in open-source-policy.md will be made available in this repository over the next 12 months.
